#CodeVita 2013(Zombie World)
#######################################################################################################


One day Bob is playing Zombie World video game. In Zombie World game each round will contain N zombie’s and each zombie’s energy is Zi (where 1 <= i <= N).

Bob will start the round with B energy. In order to move to the next level Bob need to kill all the N zombie’s but Bob can select any one among N Zombies. If energy of Bob (B) is less than Zombie energy (Zi) then Bob will die and lose the round else Bob will won, during the fighting with zombie, Bob will lose his energy by ( Zi % 2 ) + ( Zi / 2 ). At any point of game Bob will play optimally. Now your task is to find out whether Bob can reach to the next level or not.

Input Format
First line will contains B and N, separated by space, where B is the energy of Bob and N is the number of Zombie. Next line will contain N spaced integers each will represent the energy of zombie.

Line 1: B N, where B is the energy of Bob and N is the number of Zombie
Line 2: Zi, where Zi is a list containing energy of zombies separated by space

Constraints

1 <= B  <= 10^9
1 <= Zi <= 10^5
Note: for this problem all the divisions are integer divisions.

Output Format:
Print YES or NO depending upon whether Bob can reach the next level or not.

#CodeVita 2015( Reverse Gear)
###########################################################################################################
A futuristic company is building an autonomous car. The scientists at the company are training the car to perform Reverse parking. To park, the car needs to be able to move in backward as well as forward direction. The car is programmed to move backwards B meters and forwards again, say F meters, in a straight line. The car does this repeatedly until it is able to park or collides with other objects. The car covers 1 meter in T units of time. There is a wall after distance D from car’s initial position in the backward direction.

The car is currently not without defects and hence often hits the wall. The scientists are devising a strategy to prevent this from happening. Your task is to help the scientists by providing them with exact information on amount of time available before the car hits the wall.

Input Format
First line contains total number of test cases, denoted by N
Next N lines, contain a tuple containing 4 values delimited by space
F B T D, where

F denotes forward displacement in meters
B denotes backward displacement in meters
T denotes time taken to cover 1 meter
D denotes distance from Car’s starting position and the wall in backward direction
Output Format
For each test case print time taken by the Car to hit the wall

Constraints
First move will always be in backward direction
1 <= N <= 100
backward displacement > forward displacement i.e. (B > F)
forward displacement (F) > 0
backward displacement (B) > 0
time (T) > 0
distance (D) > 0
All input values must be positive integers only

#Distribute Books(codevita 2019)
##########################################################################################################

For enhancing the book reading, school distributed story books to students as part of the Children’s day celebrations.

To increase the reading habit, the class teacher decided to exchange the books every weeks so that everyone will have a different book to read. She wants to know how many possible exchanges are possible.

If they have 4 books and students, the possible exchanges are 9. Bi is the book of i-th student and after the exchange he should get a different book, other than Bi.

#[CodeVita 2019] Digit Pairs
################################################################################################################

Given N three-digit numbers, your task is to find bit score of all N numbers and then print the number of pairs possible based on these calculated bit score.

Rule for calculating bit score from three digit number

From the 3-digit number:

extract largest digit and multiply by 11 then
extract smallest digit multiply by 7 then
add both the result for getting bit pairs.
Note: Bit score should be of 2-digits, if above results in a 3-digit bit score, simply ignore most significant digit.

Consider following examples:

Say, number is 286

Largest digit is 8 and smallest digit is 2
So, 8*11+2*7 =102 so ignore most significant bit , So bit score = 02.
Say, Number is 123

Largest digit is 3 and smallest digit is 1
So, 3*11+7*1=40, so bit score is 40.
Rules for making pairs from above calculated bit scores

Condition for making pairs are

Both bit scores should be in either odd position or even position to be eligible to form a pair.
Pairs can be only made if most significant digit are same and at most two pair can be made for a given significant digit.
Constraints
N<=500

Input Format

First line contains T the number of test cases. For each test case you have:
1 line contains an integer N, denoting the count of numbers
Next line contains N 3-digit integers delimited by space
Output

One integer value denoting the number of bit pairs.

Explanation
First case
After getting the most and least significant digits of the numbers and applying the formula given in Rule 1 we get the bit scores of the numbers as:

58 12 40 76 40 11 19 18

No. of pair possible are 3:

40 appears twice at odd-indices 3 and 5 respectively. Hence, this is one pair.
12, 11, 18 are at even-indices. Hence, two pairs are possible from these three-bit scores.
Hence total pairs possible is 3

Second case
We get the bitscores as: 13 44 91 98 01 91 06

We can get the following pairs: 98 and 91, because they are at 4th and 6th position respectively

We can also get 01 and 06

Hence 2 pairs completely

Third Case
We get the bitscores as 62 69 33 23 99 73 98 95 02 30 99 20. In this we can form the following pairs:

23, 20, and 2 pairs from 99, 98, 99

#Codevita(2016) Minimum Product Array
#####################################################################################################################

The task is to find the minimum sum of Products of two arrays of the same size, given that k modifications are allowed on the first array. In each modification, one array element of the first array can either be increased or decreased by 2.

Note- the product sum is Summation (A[i]*B[i]) for all i from 1 to n where n is the size of both arrays
Input Format: 
First line of the input contains n and k delimited by whitespace
Second line contains the Array A (modifiable array) with its values delimited by spaces
Third line contains the Array B (non-modifiable array) with its values delimited by spaces

Output Format:

Output the minimum sum of products of the two arrays
Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
0 ≤ |A[i]|, |B[i]| ≤ 10^5
0 ≤ K ≤ 10^9

Explanation for sample 1:

Here total numbers are 3 and total modifications allowed are 5. So we modified A[2], which is -3 and increased it by 10 (as 5 modifications are allowed). Now final sum will be
(1 * -2) + (2 * 3) + (7 * -5)
-2 + 6 - 35
-31

-31 is our final answer.

Explanation for sample 2:

Here total numbers are 5 and total modifications allowed are 3. So we modified A[1], which is 3 and decreased it by 6 (as 3 modifications are allowed).
Now final sum will be
(2 * 3) + (-3 * 4) + (4 * 2) + (5 * 3) + (4 * 2)
6 - 12 + 8 + 15 + 8
